# Backdrop-api-test
### A node-graphql api for resolving bank details and verifying users

#
### Assumptions
- A group of users exist already with a registration process in place.
- Existing user object has an is_verfied field which is set to false
- To use any of the endpoints created, users have to be authenticated
- Users can only be verified once
- The getAccountName query optionally takes in the account_name

### Question
What's a good reason why the pure Levenshtein Distance algorithm might be a more effective solution than the broader Damerauâ€“Levenshtein Distance algorithm in this specific scenario.

#### Answer
If we want to compare two names - one provided by a user and another generated by an API - and determine which name is more correct, the pure Levenshtein Distance algorithm may be a better option than the Damerau-Levenshtein Distance algorithm. This is because in this specific scenario, we only need to account for single-character edits, such as insertions, deletions, and substitutions, to determine if the user-provided name matches the API-provided name. The Damerau-Levenshtein Distance algorithm, which also accounts for transpositions, may not be necessary or relevant. By using the simpler and more efficient Levenshtein Distance algorithm, we can achieve a more optimal solution that provides greater speed and accuracy in identifying the more correct name.
